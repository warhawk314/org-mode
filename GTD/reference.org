*** DARC
**** Explanation of DUDs (marked yellow in DashBoard)

Yellow is 'nominal'. 3 3ypes:

1) 'dud' - I think this is where CPD returns 0 data, even though there is data there. Normally this stops the Cons, but
   with DARC Vader this is seen, and the Cons re-submitted, So above each 'dud' row you should see an identical Window
   Start/End range that works.

2) in 2 cases the 'pace' is above the nominal range (pace is how much faster than realtime the Cons TM is processed).
   These 2 could be false positives where the is a lot less data to process than usual, so the Cons. finishes faster !!
   The expected range was set based on experience: if what we see 4.25 and 4.83 are really OK, then we could raise the
   expected fastest speed to Yellow=5.0)

3) PC: third case and these faster jobs may be a result of that. The job seems to partially finish before re-submitted
   by DARC Vader (I assume) only from the point it failed at. So not really a dud, but a "partial job" where the end
   time is the same but the start time later. See the examples below.

**** In case the DARC PDG Gen (i.e. the process that consolidates VC2) get stuck - i.e. the LCT does not move

forward then do the following:
- try restarting the PDG processes and DARC (note DARC Vader will start PDGs automatically if PDGs are down)
If this does not help, then try to clear the DARC queue with:
- Stop DARC Vader
- Stop DARC MMI.
- Stop DARC and the three PDG processes.
- Clear consolidation queue - log in to mysql as user admin and password  (in gaiaops account on gaialta):
  mysql –u admin –verbose –p<various> –P 3308 –h 127.0.0.1  (note no gap between -p and various!, in the 'Various'(!) file search for admin and 3308)
- Then in mysql prompt:
  use DARC_DB;
  select * from QUEUE_FILL_PARAMETER_TBL;
  delete  from QUEUE_FILL_PARAMETER_TBL;
- Restart eveything

In the PDG Gen log we should see packets being extracted with increasing times, also the LCT should be
moving forward.

Note if we need to rewind the LCT then:
- Stop DARC Vader
- Start DARC MMI
- On left select DataArchive_SCOS/Data spaces/<active DB> - right click
- Change Start Time (or End Time?) and presss LCT button
- Start DARC Vader

ISO 9000 – Fundamentals and Vocabulary, which introduces the basic principles underlying management systems and explains
the terminology

ISO 9001 – Requirements, which specifies the criteria for certification

ISO 9004 – Guidelines for performance improvements goes beyond ISO 9001 by identifying how ISO 9001 can be used as a
springboard for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of a quality management system

Annex SL was designed as the common structure for ISO Management System Standards.
When Annex SL is used for ISO 9001:2015 the terms and definitions document that applies is ISO 9000:2015. 
To understand IOS 9001 you must also understand ISO 9000.

Note the following provides a good overview in the context of the security industry:
<<iso_clauses_overview_pdf>> file:C:\Users\mclements\Documents\Projects\QA\Reference\Annex-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-for-ISO-9001-2015-NG-FG-AG.pdf

*** Quality Management System (QMS) 
    
A quality management system (QMS) is a formalized system that documents processes, procedures, and responsibilities for
achieving quality policies and objectives. A QMS helps coordinate and direct an organization’s activities to meet
customer and regulatory requirements and improve its effectiveness and efficiency on a continuous basis.

ISO 9001:2015, the international standard specifying requirements for quality management systems, is the most prominent
approach to quality management systems.

While some use the term QMS to describe the ISO 9001 standard or the group of documents detailing the QMS, it actually
refers to the entirety of the system. The documents only serve to describe the system.

Quality management systems serve many purposes, including:

    Improving processes
    Reducing waste
    Lowering costs
    Facilitating and identifying training opportunities
    Engaging staff
    Setting organization-wide direction
    
*** Princibles

ISO 9000 deals with the fundamentals of quality management systems, including the eight management principles upon which
the family of standards is based:

Principle 1 – Customer focus

Organizations depend on their customers and therefore should understand current and future customer needs, should meet
customer requirements and strive to exceed customer expectations.

Principle 2 – Leadership

Leaders establish unity of purpose and direction of the organization. They should create and maintain the internal
environment in which people can become fully involved in achieving the organization's objectives.

Principle 3 – Involvement of people

People at all levels are the essence of an organization and their full involvement enables their abilities to be used
for the organization's benefit.

Principle 4 – Process approach

A desired result is achieved more efficiently when activities and related resources are managed as a process.

Principle 5 – System approach to management

Identifying, understanding and managing interrelated processes as a system contributes to the organization's
effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its objectives.

Principle 6 – Continual improvement

Continual improvement of the organization's overall performance should be a permanent objective of the organization.

Principle 7 – Factual approach to decision making

Effective decisions are based on the analysis of data and information.

Principle 8 – Mutually beneficial supplier relationships

An organization and its suppliers are interdependent and a mutually beneficial relationship enhances the ability of both
to create value.

ISO 9001 deals with the requirements that organizations wishing to meet the standard must fulfill.

*** PDCA 

Planning, Do, Check, Act.
PDCA is an improvement model which is essential to ISO 9001.

Planning -> leadership, Planning, (Support)
Do       -> (Support), Operation
Check    -> Performance Evaluation
Act      -> Improvement

*** ISO Clauses
Common clause numbers.
See [[iso_clauses_overview_pdf]]

**** 1--3 admin clauses, background, scope
**** 4: Context: what's happing in the business environment of a company.

Internal abd External issues and parties. Document conext of the company. Regular monitor and review. Laws and
regulatory rules. Consider issues arising from its social, technological, environmental, ethical, political, legal, and
economic environment. Changes in technology. Economic shifts in the organisation’s market.

All this information is known by the managing directors, founders, CEOs and other members of management but may never
have been documented. The collation and documentation of this information can be very valuable and demonstrate where you
stand as an organisation.

Organisations must clearly define what they sell, including products and services. Link this to the relevant standards
that they are governed by.

The standard requires the organisation to establish a *process-based management system*.

*Process* The process is a set of interrelated activities that transform activity inputs into outputs. For example,
Installation: The process of converting a box of components into a working security system.

*Process approach* Process approach is a management strategy that requires organisations to manage its processes and the
interactions between them. Thus you need to consider each major process of the company and their supporting processes.

All processes have:
- inputs;
- outputs;
- operational control;
- appropriate measurement & monitoring.

Each process will have support processes that underpin and enable the process to become realised.

[[file:ISO Clauses/QA_Processes_2017-11-20_15-31-50.PNG]]

Questions to ask:
- What are the inputs to the process?
- Where do the inputs come from?
- What are the outputs to the process?
- Where do the outputs go to?
- Is there an effective inter-relationship between processes?
- Who plans the process?
- Who conducts the process?
- Are responsibilities and authorities defined?
- Who monitors and measures the process?
- What resources are required for the process? - Materials, people, information,
environment, infrastructure, etc.
- What documented information is required for the operation and control over the
process?
- What competences & training are required?
- What awareness and knowledge is required?
- What methods are used to control and run the process?
- What are the risks and opportunities for the process?
- What happens when the process goes wrong or does not yield the correct output
or result?
- How can the process be improved?
- Is the process part of the management review process?
- Is the process subject to internal audit?
The answers to the questions above form the basis of the process, its control, measurement and improvement.

**** 5: Leadership (management involvement)
The top management is required to ensure that:
- the requirements set out in ISO 9001:2015 are met;
- QMS processes are delivering their intended outcomes;
- reporting on the operation of the QMS and identifying any opportunities for improvement is taking place;
- a customer focus is promoted throughout the organisation;
- whenever changes to the QMS are planned and implemented, the integrity of the system is maintained.
- write policy: Quality policy, company induction, basic training, tool box talks.

Policy - Tell everyone about it.
- Making sure it is written.
- Making sure people know it and understand it.
- Giving it to people who have an interest in your business (e.g. clients / suppliers / manufacturers / staff).
- Publishing it on your website.

**** 6: Risk based planning (in broadest possible sense, anything that can go wrong)
Clause 6.1.1 - Actions to address risks and opportunities
- When thinking about the business and service delivery, it’s about ensuring that the system you use it right for this.
  This could include anything from the way in which you sell, to the technology you use in the office.
- Doing extra to make sure the outcome is better than you had hoped for.
- Putting safety measures in place to ensure things don’t go wrong, training for staff, supervision, margins that are
  realistic which means you can rival your competitor but still remain profitable.
- Actually get better at what you are doing, selling providing, servicing, etc.

Clause 6.2 - Quality objectives and planning to achieve them
Ensure that whatever objectives you implement they are SMART
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Realistic
- Time bound

Clause 6.3 – Planning of changes
When a business changes something, the impact of the change needs to be considered before a change is made.

**** 7: Support
Resources needed to run management system, external providers (info needed), contractors, equipment, hardware, software.
People having the right info
The organisation needs to decide what tools it uses to measure business performance. It also needs to consider whether
these tools will give them everything they need as a result.
Communication.
Documented information
Remembering that to the extent necessary:
a) maintain documented information to support the operation of its processes (i.e. procedures, etc.);
b) retain documented information to have confidence that the processes are being carried out as planned (i.e. records).

**** 8: Operation
Businesses are expected that, once they have done their planning for what they are going to sell, they then plan the
detail of how this can be done operationally.
- Set up supplier accounts / trade accounts.
- Purchase stock.
- Ensure staff have correct skills and understand the process.
- Purchase tools and vehicles.
- Make sure you have enough staff.
- Issue clear instructions, drawings, procedures risk assessments to enable them to do the job.
 
customer reqs, reviewing reqs, design and development, managing external providers (products and services from them),
what u do as a business, main thing you deliver. Deliver what we set out to deliver.

**** 9. Performance evaluation
How we measure success of business (effectives).
What are the key indicators suggesting business is working, targets being
achieved. *Internal auditing*. Management review.

**** 10. Improvement: continual improvement, Correction (fixing a problem),
Corrective action (do that it does not happen again). Fixing action.
improvement is the spirit of IOS 9001 (and Annex SL)
When something goes wrong you must:
a) react to it:
 1) do something / take action / fix it;
 2) deal with the impact it had (e.g. upset customer).
b) evaluate what went wrong to prevent it happening again and check there are not other similar issues that could happen.
Key now is to update risks and opportunities.

It might be that, during a review, the control measures within a process are insufficient and do not give the level of
assurance perhaps that the Directors want to know that processes are being followed correctly, e.g. sales process does
not include a deadline or record of when a quote is sent out so you do not have clear idea of how productive your team
are being.

*** Verification vs Validation

Each of these steps is important in the design process because they serve two distinct functions. *Verification* is a
theoretical exercise designed to make sure that no requirements are missed in the design, whereas *validation* is a
practical exercise that ensures that the product, as built, will function to meet the requirements. Together, they
ensure that the product designed will satisfy the customer needs, and the needs of the customer are one of the key
focuses for ISO 9001 and improving Customer Satisfaction.
** Dictionay
Conformity
ISO 9000 uses conformity as fulfilling either process or product requirements. ISO 9000 defines nonconformity
as the non-fulfillment of a requirement. It doesn’t define compliance. The ISO 9000:2000 Fundamentals and Vocabulary
standard defines conformity as the fulfillment of a requirement. A note says conformance is synonymous, but deprecated
(meaning use of that term is considered obsolete).

Quality Planning
Quality Planning is a systematic process that translates quality policy into measurable objectives and requirements, and
lays down a sequence of steps for realising them within a specified timeframe. This is achieved for a product or service
in the form of a Quality Assurance Plan. Qualit y planning is a mandatory activity in all projects in our company.

Project Quality Engineer (PQE)
A Project Quality Engineer ( PQE ) who are responsible for ensuring the Quality Requirements specified in the applicable
contract are implemented satisfactorily within a project .

IMS (TPZV)
The requirements imposed by the Integrated Management System ( IMS ) which is certified by DNV GL as satisfying the
requirements of ISO 9001:2008 (Certificate 122233 - 2012 - AQ - GBR - UKAS) shall be addressed and implemented as
appropriate to the individual s ervic e project .

TPZV Generic QAP for Service Projects
The requirements imposed by the Integrated Management System (IMS) which is certified by DNV GL as satisfying the
requirements of ISO 9001:2008 (Certificate 122233 - 2012 - AQ - GBR - UKAS) shall be addressed and implemented as
appropriate to the individual service project.
The Quality Plan addresses those generic requirements of a service project and relate s them to the overall management
system (= IMS) processes. It also identifies the role of Quality Assurance and the associated activities to be performed
to ensure the contract conditions are met. As such, t he generic QA Plan shall also form the basis for internal and/or
external audits of service contracts, in the absence of individual, project - specific Quality Assurance Plans. Please r
efer to section 5.1 for more information.
My interpretation: We do internal Audits to check adherance of projects to TPZV's IMS; ESOC do their own
Audits to check again ESOC's QMS. This Generic QAP if for the former.

Limit of Liability (LoL) 
Some TPZV service projects follow a so-called Time & Materials ( T&M ) cost model. This means the contracted value is
based on a daily or hourly rate and can either have a Limit of Liability ( LoL ) defined by the Client or is open 
ended and dependant on the work undertaken.

Quality Record 
Quality record is any document or form providing objective
evidence that activities have been performed or results have been achieved on
the project, in accordance with requirements. In order to make them readily
identifiable and retrievable, quality records will be kept under configuration
control (local and/or centralised, according to their objec tives).

Corrective and Preventive Actions
A corrective action deals with a nonconformity that has occurred, and a preventive action addresses the potential for a
nonconformity to occur.

   Definitions: (From ISO 9000)
   Corrective Action
   
   The action to eliminate the cause of a detected nonconformity or other undesirable situation.
   NOTE 1 There can be more than one cause for a nonconformity.
   NOTE 2 Corrective action is taken to prevent recurrence whereas preventive action is taken to prevent occurrence.
   NOTE 3 There is a distinction between correction and corrective action.
   
   Preventive Action
   The action to eliminate the cause of a potential nonconformity or other undesirable potential situation
   NOTE 1 There can be more than one cause for a potential nonconformity.
   NOTE 2 Preventive action is taken to prevent occurrence whereas corrective action is taken to prevent recurrence.
   
   Correction
   The action to eliminate a detected nonconformity
   NOTE 1 A correction can be made in conjunction with a corrective action.
   NOTE 2 A correction can be, for example, rework or regrade.
