This procedure provides the required steps to replay TM from one data stream on another one using the TM
Replayer functionality of TM Spacon. An example use case is replaying 2002 data on data stream 1002 in case of
an incomplete ONLC VC2 archive. Since the verifier does not consider S1 packets being received on the offline
stream, this functionality enables the user to consolidate TC verification states.

  Hi Norbert,
  
  I have had a quick look through the docs (thanks) but my main concern/question is about the versions of SMF and SMF_S2K which, by my understanding need to be exactly compatible. Neither myself nor Pete could remember if anyone was looking specifically at checking this, hence my email.
  
  Gaia is currently based on:
  - (S2K 5.4.21 + patches)
  - SMF 2.4.0 + smf#624, matis25#21, smf#639, smf#640, smf#641, smf#637, smf#642
  - SMF_S2K 5.4.21 + automati#107, automati#114 +Gaia extensions (for access to new Gaia functionality in TM Spacon, FTM etc.)
  
  When it is available (hopefully soon) we will migrate to:
  - SMF 2.4.1i3
  - SMF_S2K 5.4.23 (to which we will migrate the Gaia extensions
  
  I am not sure whether you can answer this question directly, but maybe you can pass the email to someone who can !

*** ECS/LMS 1.0.8 
**** Restart of stop working
[2018-01-12 Fr] Dear all,

It could be that the LMS TM stopped being archived at 01:59 on 10th ?
If so then I think Ran usually just restarts LMS/SMF?

Regards, Simon
**** ECSB
My understanding is that ECSB is the Halley machine (confusing for us on Gaia where usually 'a'=Halley and 'b'=Deneb !),
and is the Prime LMS Server for Gaia. Gaia LMS reports ECSB errors because that is what it is configured for

As mentioned by Simon, Gaia connects to ecsb (on Halley) as our prime LMS server. I assume this means we use LMS-B, i.e.
ecsa runs LMS-A, ecsb runs LMS-B. Therefore if LMS-B is the operational one then it should be fine.

[2018-01-12 Fr] Hi Simon, 
exactly on that day at that time we had a possible SMF issue (also MATIS malfunctioned) which we' re analysing with
Lukasz. After this problem, later in the morning, I restarted the whole Automation chain including SMF and LMS server.
Is the LMS data archiving working again?

  Hi GAIA SwS, 
  
  With DARC-614 we are aiming at further optimising the DARC delete operations. The optimisation as defined in the investigation, will be valid only for scheduled delete jobs for all parameters (manual delete jobs will remain as they are now). I know that in GAIA you are not using the schedule delete features but triggering the delete via Darc vader. For that reason, could you please confirm that the delete jobs would be identified by the system as scheduled delete jobs and therefore be able to benefit from the optimisation to be provided by this SCR? 
  
  Thanks for the clarification.

  Dear all,
  
  I have patched gaialta with the same patch as has been tested on gaialtb over the last few weeks.
  
  (For those not in the Gaia Weekly FCT Meeting today my crontab killing of the PDGs (restarted by DARC Vader) has created
  several hits of an Ongoing Consolidation and Live TM at the same time, and the DARC has logged them and recovered
  correctly).
  
  I also followed the relevant sections of GND-GO-0010 and restarted the EDDS Servers, ARES and WebMUST.
  
  We will see how tonight's Consolidation goes !
  
  (@Pete: I suggest we leave the SPACONs doing the Dump Acks on *both* LTA machines, at least till the end of the week,
  just to provide a reference in case we see any Consolidation anomaly on gaialta.)

**** Explanation of DUDs (marked yellow in DashBoard) + Dashboard Jobs Display

Yellow is 'nominal'. 3 3ypes:

1) 'dud' - I think this is where CPD returns 0 data, even though there is data there. Normally this stops the Cons, but
   with DARC Vader this is seen, and the Cons re-submitted, So above each 'dud' row you should see an identical Window
   Start/End range that works.

2) in 2 cases the 'pace' is above the nominal range (pace is how much faster than realtime the Cons TM is processed).
   These 2 could be false positives where the is a lot less data to process than usual, so the Cons. finishes faster !!
   The expected range was set based on experience: if what we see 4.25 and 4.83 are really OK, then we could raise the
   expected fastest speed to Yellow=5.0)

3) PC: third case and these faster jobs may be a result of that. The job seems to partially finish before re-submitted
   by DARC Vader (I assume) only from the point it failed at. So not really a dud, but a "partial job" where the end
   time is the same but the start time later. See the examples below.

#+DOWNLOADED: file:C%3A/Users/mclements/Documents/Emacs/GTD/Images/DARC_Dud_Jobs.png @ 2017-12-07 15:28:50
[[file:Gaia/DARC_Dud_Jobs_2017-12-07_15-28-50.png]]

NOTE !!

4/1/18: The Dashboard is currently configured to show *all* jobs for the last 3
days, but for days 4-10 it only shows the *Yellow/Red* entries, not the OK ones
! (If you want to check the older OK ones, you scroll back to an older Dashboard
page.)

**** In case the DARC PDG Gen (i.e. the process that consolidates VC2) get stuck - i.e. the LCT does not move

forward then do the following:
- try restarting the PDG processes and DARC (note DARC Vader will start PDGs automatically if PDGs are down)
If this does not help, then try to clear the DARC queue with:
- Stop DARC Vader
- Stop DARC MMI.
- Stop DARC and the three PDG processes.
- Clear consolidation queue - log in to mysql as user admin and password  (in gaiaops account on gaialta):
  mysql –u admin –verbose –p<various> –P 3308 –h 127.0.0.1  (note no gap between -p and various!, in the 'Various'(!) file search for admin and 3308)
- Then in mysql prompt:
  use DARC_DB;
  select * from QUEUE_FILL_PARAMETER_TBL;
  delete  from QUEUE_FILL_PARAMETER_TBL;
- Restart eveything

In the PDG Gen log we should see packets being extracted with increasing times, also the LCT should be
moving forward.

Note if we need to rewind the LCT then:
- Stop DARC Vader
- Start DARC MMI
- On left select DataArchive_SCOS/Data spaces/<active DB> - right click
- Change Start Time (or End Time?) and presss LCT button
- Start DARC Vader

**** Explanation of DARC/PDG Patch to prevent Unintentional Jump Forward 
Note: patch installed first on gaialtb, then on gaialta (19/12/17)

Hi Simon, 

Just to clarify on the observation reported in this email. Even after the patch,
the consolidation can prematurely stop if the retrieval from S2K provides a
packet outside the consolidation time range (even if there is a jump larger than
the max allowed by configuration) since the main objective of the patch was to
prevent updates to the LCT that would cause gaps in the data. If the
consolidation stops prematurely without updating the LCT, this should not cause
a gap and the interval (in case there was really missing data) would be
populated with the next consolidation. We could introduce a similar approach for
the package data received from S2K (based on the package time) however this
would introduce yet another level of complexity with limited benefits (from the
tests this scenario didn't seem to happen very often and would not cause a data
gap).

@Nick: feel free to correct me in case my knowledge of the final version of the
patch is incorrect.

Cheers, 
Rui 

**** DARC Delete Jobs 
Perfect. This would mean GAIA could benefit from this SCR immediate without any further update to Darc vader.

Hi Rui,

I can confirm that the Delete jobs are logged as "TYPE: SCHEDULED_DELETE_DYNAMIC_DATA".

Regards, Simon

Hi GAIA SwS, 

With DARC-614 we are aiming at further optimising the DARC delete operations.
The optimisation as defined in the investigation, will be valid only for
scheduled delete jobs for all parameters (manual delete jobs will remain as they
are now). I know that in GAIA you are not using the schedule delete features but

that the delete jobs would be identified by the system as scheduled delete jobs
and therefore be able to benefit from the optimisation to be provided by this
SCR?

Thanks for the clarification. 
**** DARC Delete Jobs - Manual Deletion 
If the DARC DB (e.g. on LTB) fills up, then can manually delete data by selecting archive (on left) and then select time
range to delete. Note normally LTB DARC is not running (nor DARC Vader), so live data is not processed and hence the
DARC DB does not fill up (assuming consolidation by Spacon is also not done).
**** Restart of DARC (and due to DUDs) 
PC: 31/1/18: The DARC seems to be having some problems with the last couple of consolidations, with many duds. We just
re-started DARC on LTA and let DARC Vader re-start everything, so hopefully it improves now. No gaps in ARES observed so
far though. Re-starting DARC automatically after a configurable number of duds is precisely one of the improvements
Joerg is working on, so hopefully this will be dealt with better in future.

** Dashboard 
*** Cannot access Dashboard on gaiamca/gaiamcb
This (and other symptoms) suggests a glitch between the Ops and Dev LANs since last Friday.
I have restarted the tunnels (see - Tunnel below) on gaiamca and gaimcb and the Dashboard is accessible again.

- Nominally the WS Dashboard connects to gaiamcb:8080. But if the fails the first to try is gaiamca:8080 (just edit the address in the URL bar).
- Failing that you can try directly from you laptop to go the Dashboard at http://gaialtd:8080/ (DevLAN)

On servers gaiamca and gaiamcb there are ssh tunnels in place from inside OPSLAN to DEVLAN so the dashboard can be seen on OPSLAN too.
The tunnel may need to be (re)started on gaiamca or gaiamcb if 'glitch' between DEV and OPS LAN. See Maintenance Procedures section 3.1.:

    ssh -g -N -L 8080:gaialtd.dev.esoc.esa.int:8080 gaialib@gaialtd.dev.esoc.esa.int

** Gaia Main Dates/Timeline 
*** Mission Lifetime
During its meeting at ESA Headquarters in Paris, on 21-22 November, the SPC approved indicative extensions for the
continued operation of five ESA-led missions: Gaia, INTEGRAL, Mars Express, SOHO, and XMM-Newton. This followed a
comprehensive review of the current operational status and outlook of the missions and their expected scientific returns
during the extension period. The decision will be subject to confirmation towards the end of 2018.

The lifetime of Gaia, ESA's billion star surveyor, was extended by eighteen months, from 25 July 2019 to 31
December 2020. This is the first time that Gaia, which was launched in 2013 and originally funded for a five-year
mission, has been subject to the extension process.

** ESOC Badges 
Badge Types
(JB request [2018-01-17 Mi]) I'm afraid that there is no justification for the business partner badge - in fact since a
few years now, those are only meant to be issued to CEOs of contracting companies. Either you need regular access (e.g.
for SWS purposes) in which case you qualify for an interim badge, or you only need occasional access, for which a
visitor badge (and unfortunately its corresponding annoyances) is sufficient.

ISO 9004 – Guidelines for performance improvements goes beyond ISO 9001 by identifying how ISO 9001 can be used as a

*** Quality Management System (QMS) 
    
A quality management system (QMS) is a formalized system that documents processes, procedures, and responsibilities for
achieving quality policies and objectives. A QMS helps coordinate and direct an organization’s activities to meet
customer and regulatory requirements and improve its effectiveness and efficiency on a continuous basis.

ISO 9001:2015, the international standard specifying requirements for quality management systems, is the most prominent
approach to quality management systems.

While some use the term QMS to describe the ISO 9001 standard or the group of documents detailing the QMS, it actually
refers to the entirety of the system. The documents only serve to describe the system.

Quality management systems serve many purposes, including:

    Improving processes
    Reducing waste
    Lowering costs
    Facilitating and identifying training opportunities
    Engaging staff
    Setting organization-wide direction
    
*** Princibles

ISO 9000 deals with the fundamentals of quality management systems, including the eight management principles upon which
the family of standards is based:

Principle 1 – Customer focus

Organizations depend on their customers and therefore should understand current and future customer needs, should meet
customer requirements and strive to exceed customer expectations.

Principle 2 – Leadership

Leaders establish unity of purpose and direction of the organization. They should create and maintain the internal
environment in which people can become fully involved in achieving the organization's objectives.

Principle 3 – Involvement of people

People at all levels are the essence of an organization and their full involvement enables their abilities to be used
for the organization's benefit.

Principle 4 – Process approach

A desired result is achieved more efficiently when activities and related resources are managed as a process.

Principle 5 – System approach to management

Identifying, understanding and managing interrelated processes as a system contributes to the organization's
effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its objectives.

Principle 6 – Continual improvement

Continual improvement of the organization's overall performance should be a permanent objective of the organization.

Principle 7 – Factual approach to decision making

Effective decisions are based on the analysis of data and information.

Principle 8 – Mutually beneficial supplier relationships

An organization and its suppliers are interdependent and a mutually beneficial relationship enhances the ability of both
to create value.

ISO 9001 deals with the requirements that organizations wishing to meet the standard must fulfill.

*** PDCA 

Planning, Do, Check, Act.
PDCA is an improvement model which is essential to ISO 9001.

Planning -> leadership, Planning, (Support)
Do       -> (Support), Operation
Check    -> Performance Evaluation
Act      -> Improvement

*** ISO Clauses
Common clause numbers.
See [[iso_clauses_overview_pdf]]

**** 1--3 admin clauses, background, scope
**** 4: Context: what's happing in the business environment of a company.

Internal abd External issues and parties. Document conext of the company. Regular monitor and review. Laws and
regulatory rules. Consider issues arising from its social, technological, environmental, ethical, political, legal, and
economic environment. Changes in technology. Economic shifts in the organisation’s market.

All this information is known by the managing directors, founders, CEOs and other members of management but may never
have been documented. The collation and documentation of this information can be very valuable and demonstrate where you
stand as an organisation.

Organisations must clearly define what they sell, including products and services. Link this to the relevant standards
that they are governed by.

The standard requires the organisation to establish a *process-based management system*.

*Process* The process is a set of interrelated activities that transform activity inputs into outputs. For example,
Installation: The process of converting a box of components into a working security system.

*Process approach* Process approach is a management strategy that requires organisations to manage its processes and the
interactions between them. Thus you need to consider each major process of the company and their supporting processes.

All processes have:
- inputs;
- outputs;
- operational control;
- appropriate measurement & monitoring.

Each process will have support processes that underpin and enable the process to become realised.

[[file:ISO Clauses/QA_Processes_2017-11-20_15-31-50.PNG]]

Questions to ask:
- What are the inputs to the process?
- Where do the inputs come from?
- What are the outputs to the process?
- Where do the outputs go to?
- Is there an effective inter-relationship between processes?
- Who plans the process?
- Who conducts the process?
- Are responsibilities and authorities defined?
- Who monitors and measures the process?
- What resources are required for the process? - Materials, people, information,
environment, infrastructure, etc.
- What documented information is required for the operation and control over the
process?
- What competences & training are required?
- What awareness and knowledge is required?
- What methods are used to control and run the process?
- What are the risks and opportunities for the process?
- What happens when the process goes wrong or does not yield the correct output
or result?
- How can the process be improved?
- Is the process part of the management review process?
- Is the process subject to internal audit?
The answers to the questions above form the basis of the process, its control, measurement and improvement.

**** 5: Leadership (management involvement)
The top management is required to ensure that:
- the requirements set out in ISO 9001:2015 are met;
- QMS processes are delivering their intended outcomes;
- reporting on the operation of the QMS and identifying any opportunities for improvement is taking place;
- a customer focus is promoted throughout the organisation;
- whenever changes to the QMS are planned and implemented, the integrity of the system is maintained.
- write policy: Quality policy, company induction, basic training, tool box talks.

Policy - Tell everyone about it.
- Making sure it is written.
- Making sure people know it and understand it.
- Giving it to people who have an interest in your business (e.g. clients / suppliers / manufacturers / staff).
- Publishing it on your website.

**** 6: Risk based planning (in broadest possible sense, anything that can go wrong)
Clause 6.1.1 - Actions to address risks and opportunities
- When thinking about the business and service delivery, it’s about ensuring that the system you use it right for this.
  This could include anything from the way in which you sell, to the technology you use in the office.
- Doing extra to make sure the outcome is better than you had hoped for.
- Putting safety measures in place to ensure things don’t go wrong, training for staff, supervision, margins that are
  realistic which means you can rival your competitor but still remain profitable.
- Actually get better at what you are doing, selling providing, servicing, etc.

Clause 6.2 - Quality objectives and planning to achieve them
Ensure that whatever objectives you implement they are SMART
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Realistic
- Time bound

Clause 6.3 – Planning of changes
When a business changes something, the impact of the change needs to be considered before a change is made.

**** 7: Support
Resources needed to run management system, external providers (info needed), contractors, equipment, hardware, software.
People having the right info
The organisation needs to decide what tools it uses to measure business performance. It also needs to consider whether
these tools will give them everything they need as a result.
Communication.
Documented information
Remembering that to the extent necessary:
a) maintain documented information to support the operation of its processes (i.e. procedures, etc.);
b) retain documented information to have confidence that the processes are being carried out as planned (i.e. records).

**** 8: Operation
Businesses are expected that, once they have done their planning for what they are going to sell, they then plan the
detail of how this can be done operationally.
- Set up supplier accounts / trade accounts.
- Purchase stock.
- Ensure staff have correct skills and understand the process.
- Purchase tools and vehicles.
- Make sure you have enough staff.
- Issue clear instructions, drawings, procedures risk assessments to enable them to do the job.
 
customer reqs, reviewing reqs, design and development, managing external providers (products and services from them),
what u do as a business, main thing you deliver. Deliver what we set out to deliver.

**** 9. Performance evaluation
How we measure success of business (effectives).
What are the key indicators suggesting business is working, targets being
achieved. *Internal auditing*. Management review.

**** 10. Improvement: continual improvement, Correction (fixing a problem),
Corrective action (do that it does not happen again). Fixing action.
improvement is the spirit of IOS 9001 (and Annex SL)
When something goes wrong you must:
a) react to it:
 1) do something / take action / fix it;
 2) deal with the impact it had (e.g. upset customer).
b) evaluate what went wrong to prevent it happening again and check there are not other similar issues that could happen.
Key now is to update risks and opportunities.

It might be that, during a review, the control measures within a process are insufficient and do not give the level of
assurance perhaps that the Directors want to know that processes are being followed correctly, e.g. sales process does
not include a deadline or record of when a quote is sent out so you do not have clear idea of how productive your team
are being.

*** Verification vs Validation

Each of these steps is important in the design process because they serve two distinct functions. *Verification* is a
_theoretical_ exercise designed to make sure that no requirements are missed in the design, whereas *validation* is a
_practical_ exercise that ensures that the product, as built, will function to meet the requirements. Together, they
ensure that the product designed will satisfy the customer needs, and the needs of the customer are one of the key
focuses for ISO 9001 and improving Customer Satisfaction.

**** Verification
ISO/IEC 15288:2008:
The purpose of the Verification Process is to confirm that the specified design
requirements are fulfilled by the system. 

This process provides the information required to effect the remedial actions
that correct non‐conformances in the realized system or the processes that act
on it.

INCOSE:
The Verification Process confirms that the system‐of‐interest and all its
elements perform their intended functions and meet the performance requirements
allocated to them (i.e., that the system has been built right). Verification
methods include inspection, analysis, demonstration, and verification and are
discussed in more detail below. Verification activities are determined by the
perceived risks, safety, and criticality of the element under consideration.

--

System verification ensures that the system, its elements, and its interfaces
conform to their requirements; in other words that “you built it right.”
Verification encompasses the tasks, actions, and activities performed to
evaluate the progress and effectiveness of the evolving system solutions
(people, products, and process) and to measure compliance with requirements. The
primary purpose of verification is to determine that system specifications,
designs, processes, and products are compliant with requirements. A *continuous*
feedback of verification data helps to reduce risk and to surface problems
early. The goal is to completely verify system capability to meet all
requirements prior to production and operation stages. Problems uncovered at in
these stages are very costly to correct (see Figure 2‐4). As such, early
discovery of deviations from requirements reduces overall project risk and helps
the project deliver a successful, low‐cost system.29 Verification results are an
important element of decision gate reviews.

Verification analysis can be initiated once a design concept has been
established. If an RVTM is used, each requirement has a verification activity
associated with it. A unique requirements identifier can be used for
traceability to the verification plans, verification procedures, and
verification reports to provide a closed loop Verification Process from
demonstrated capability back to the requirement.

** Dictionay
Conformity
ISO 9000 uses conformity as fulfilling either process or product requirements. ISO 9000 defines nonconformity
as the non-fulfillment of a requirement. It doesn’t define compliance. The ISO 9000:2000 Fundamentals and Vocabulary
standard defines conformity as the fulfillment of a requirement. A note says conformance is synonymous, but deprecated
(meaning use of that term is considered obsolete).

Quality Planning
Quality Planning is a systematic process that translates quality policy into measurable objectives and requirements, and
lays down a sequence of steps for realising them within a specified timeframe. This is achieved for a product or service
in the form of a Quality Assurance Plan. Qualit y planning is a mandatory activity in all projects in our company.

Project Quality Engineer (PQE)
A Project Quality Engineer ( PQE ) who are responsible for ensuring the Quality Requirements specified in the applicable
contract are implemented satisfactorily within a project .

IMS (TPZV)
The requirements imposed by the Integrated Management System ( IMS ) which is certified by DNV GL as satisfying the
requirements of ISO 9001:2008 (Certificate 122233 - 2012 - AQ - GBR - UKAS) shall be addressed and implemented as
appropriate to the individual servic or project.

TPZV Generic QAP for Service Projects
The requirements imposed by the Integrated Management System (IMS) which is certified by DNV GL as satisfying the
requirements of ISO 9001:2008 (Certificate 122233 - 2012 - AQ - GBR - UKAS) shall be addressed and implemented as
appropriate to the individual service project.
The Quality Plan addresses those generic requirements of a service project and relate s them to the overall management
system (= IMS) processes. It also identifies the role of Quality Assurance and the associated activities to be performed
to ensure the contract conditions are met. As such, t he generic QA Plan shall also form the basis for internal and/or
external audits of service contracts, in the absence of individual, project - specific Quality Assurance Plans. Please r
efer to section 5.1 for more information.
My interpretation: We do internal Audits to check adherance of projects to TPZV's IMS; ESOC do their own
Audits to check again ESOC's QMS. This Generic QAP if for the former.

Limit of Liability (LoL) 
Some TPZV service projects follow a so-called Time & Materials ( T&M ) cost model. This means the contracted value is
based on a daily or hourly rate and can either have a Limit of Liability ( LoL ) defined by the Client or is open 
ended and dependant on the work undertaken.

Quality Record 
Quality record is any document or form providing objective evidence that activities have been performed or results have
been achieved on the project, in accordance with requirements. In order to make them readily identifiable and
retrievable, quality records will be kept under configuration control (local and/or centralised, according to their
objec tives).

Corrective and Preventive Actions
A corrective action deals with a nonconformity that has occurred, and a preventive action addresses the potential for a
nonconformity to occur.

   Definitions: (From ISO 9000)
   Corrective Action
   
   The action to eliminate the cause of a detected nonconformity or other undesirable situation.
   NOTE 1 There can be more than one cause for a nonconformity.
   NOTE 2 Corrective action is taken to prevent recurrence whereas preventive action is taken to prevent occurrence.
   NOTE 3 There is a distinction between correction and corrective action.
   
   Preventive Action
   The action to eliminate the cause of a potential nonconformity or other undesirable potential situation
   NOTE 1 There can be more than one cause for a potential nonconformity.
   NOTE 2 Preventive action is taken to prevent occurrence whereas corrective action is taken to prevent recurrence.
   
   Correction
   The action to eliminate a detected nonconformity
   NOTE 1 A correction can be made in conjunction with a corrective action.
   NOTE 2 A correction can be, for example, rework or regrade.
